                        <p class="text">I am a new UX/UI designer with still lots to learn. I first heard about UX design from my Father who encouraged me to find a career that I liked and would like to pursue. Knowing I liked graphic design, he recommended I look in to UX design. I am very exited to continue to learn more about UX/UI in the future. <br>In my free time I like to do a lot of different things. I like to play videogames. I honestly don't have a specific type of video game that I like to play. My favorite game right now is Watchdogs 2(was free on game pass). I like to watch sports in my free time. My favorite sport to watch is baseball. My favorite team to root for are the Los Angeles Dodgers. I also like to create 3D models and animation(see personal projects). I like making things that just pop into my head, sometimes they look cool but other times they look terrible. I also like to listen to music(of course who doesn't). I don't really care about the genre, just as long as it has a good rhythm. My favorite band/artists are Mike Shinoda, Rise Against, Mana, and what ever mix on Spotify is good.</p>
